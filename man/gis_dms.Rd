\description{
SI users with a domain found to match the domain of a
GI company are automatically upgraded to a premium
membership which grants them access to open events and other
things. Because coding is not 100\% clean in SF, we provide an
exclusion list of ids for accounts already identified to be
members or consituents for NC companies. This should be
simplified in the future.

Retrieve all DMs from the GI companies.
